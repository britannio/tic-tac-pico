# Tic-Tac-Pico

An implementation of [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) on the Arducam Pico4ML board. This was created by myself as a task for other students to attempt in the [Computer Systems II](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/modules/comp2215) module

See https://github.com/britannio/tic-tac-toe for my unbeatable implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe in Haskell.
